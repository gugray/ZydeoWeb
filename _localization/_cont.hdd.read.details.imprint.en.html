  <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
  <p><b>Limitation of liability for internal content</b></p>
  <p>
    The content of this website has been compiled with meticulous care and to the best of my knowledge.
    However, I cannot assume any liability for the up-to-dateness, completeness or accuracy of any
    of the pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pursuant to section 7, para. 1 of the TMG (Telemediengesetz – Tele Media Act by German law),
    I as a service provider am liable for my own content on these pages in accordance with general laws.
    However, pursuant to sections 8 to 10 of the TMG, I as a service provider am not under obligation
    to monitor external information provided or stored on this website. Once I have become aware of
    a specific infringement of the law, I will immediately remove the content in question.
    Any liability concerning this matter can only be assumed from the point in time at which
    the infringement becomes known to me.
  </p>
  <p><b>Limitation of liability for external links</b></p>
  <p>
    This website contains links to the websites of third parties (“external links”).
    As the content of these websites is not under my control, I cannot assume any
    liability for such external content. In all cases, the provider of information of the
    linked websites is liable for the content and accuracy of the information provided.
    At the point in time when the links were placed, no infringements of the law were
    recognisable to me. As soon as an infringement of the law becomes known to me,
    I will immediately remove the link in question.

    Any duplication, processing, distribution or any form of utilisation beyond the scope of

  <p><b>Data protection</b></p>
  <p>
    A visit to this website can result in the server-side storage of information about the access
    (date, time, page accessed). This does not represent any analysis of personal data
    (e.g., name, address or e-mail address). If personal data are collected, this only
    occurs – to the extent possible – with the prior consent of the user of the website.
    Any forwarding of the data to third parties without the express consent of the user
    shall not take place.
  </p>
  <p>
    I would like to expressly point out that the transmission of data via the Internet
    (e.g., by e-mail) can offer security vulnerabilities. It is therefore impossible to
    safeguard the data completely against access by third parties. I cannot assume any
    liability for damages arising as a result of such security vulnerabilities.

    The use by third parties of all published contact details for the purpose of advertising
    is expressly excluded. I reserve the right to take legal steps in the case of the
    unsolicited sending of advertising information; e.g., by means of spam mail.
